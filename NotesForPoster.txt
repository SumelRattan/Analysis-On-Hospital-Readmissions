Readmission Risk Factors Summary
ChatGPT
Here are the insights from the poster based on the provided content:

---

### **Key Demographics and Clinical Factors Affecting Readmissions**
- **Non-Diabetes Variables:**  
  - Common diagnoses included circulatory and respiratory issues.  
  - The majority of patients were aged 60–90.  
  - Most had normal or healthy weight, and glucose levels were evenly distributed between normal and abnormal.  
  - Around 47% of patients were readmitted.

- **Medications:**  
  - 79% of patients were prescribed diabetes-specific medications.  
  - Patients with medication changes had a higher likelihood of readmissions.

---

### **Effects of Primary Diabetes Diagnosis on Readmissions**
- **Statistical Findings:**  
  - A chi-square test found a significant association between readmissions and patients with primary diabetes diagnoses.  
  - Readmission rates were high among primary diabetes patients (53%).  
  - Patients aged 70–80 had the highest readmission rates for diabetes-related diagnoses.

---

### **Factors Affecting Readmissions by Age Group**
- **Demographics by Age:**  
  - Older patients (70–90) faced higher readmission rates.  
  - Common diagnoses varied by age group, with circulatory and respiratory diagnoses prominent in older age groups.  
  - Patients with comorbidities and polypharmacy showed increased readmission risk.

---

### **Risk Factors for Readmissions**
- **Identified Risks:**  
  - Key risks include frequent ER visits, prior diabetes diagnoses, and changes in diabetes medication.  
  - Forest plot analysis showed significant odds ratios for these risk factors.

---

### **Protective Factors for Readmissions**
- **Univariate and Multivariate Analysis:**  
  - Lower readmission likelihood was associated with fewer comorbidities (1-2 diagnoses).  
  - Primary musculoskeletal and secondary injury diagnoses reduced readmission risk.  
  - General surgery specialty also acted as a protective factor.

---

### **Summary**
- The study revealed a 47.01% readmission rate, with major factors being age, diagnosis type, and healthcare usage.  
- Patients aged 70–90 and those with circulatory/respiratory issues or primary diabetes diagnoses were at higher risk.  
- Protective factors included fewer comorbidities, musculoskeletal diagnoses, and surgery specialties.  
- Recommendations emphasize targeted interventions to address these risk factors and reduce readmission rates.
